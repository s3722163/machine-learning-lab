    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last couple of weeks we learned about the typical ML model development process. In this weeks lab we will explore decision tree based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lab assumes that you have completed the labs for week 2-5. If you havent yet, please do so before attempting this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lab can be executed on either your own machine (with anaconda installation) or on AWS educate classroom setup for the course. \n",
    "- Please refer canvas for instructions on installing anaconda python or setting up AWS Sagemaker notebook: [Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Classrooms](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/79534/pages/introduction-to-amazon-web-services-aws-classrooms?module_item_id=2952364)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "- Continue to familiarise with Python and other ML packages.\n",
    "- Learning classification decision trees from both categorical and continuous numerical data\n",
    "- Comparing the performance of various trees after pruned.\n",
    "- Learning regression decision trees and comparing these models to regression models from previous labs.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. \n",

    "#### Input variables:\n",
    "- Bank client data:\n",
    "    1. age (numeric)\n",

    "    3. marital : marital status (categorical: \"married\",\"divorced\",\"single\"; note: \"divorced\" means divorced or widowed)\n",
    "    4. education (categorical: \"unknown\",\"secondary\",\"primary\",\"tertiary\")\n",

    "- Related with the last contact of the current campaign:\n",
    "    9. contact: contact communication type (categorical: \"unknown\",\"telephone\",\"cellular\") \n",
    "    10. day: last contact day of the month (numeric)\n",
    "    11. month: last contact month of year (categorical: \"jan\", \"feb\", \"mar\", ..., \"nov\", \"dec\")\n",
    "    12. duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)\n",
    "- Other attributes:\n",
    "    13. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n",
    "    14. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "    15. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "    16. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: \"unknown\",\"other\",\"failure\",\"success\")\n",
    "    \n",

    "    17. y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: \"yes\",\"no\")\n",
